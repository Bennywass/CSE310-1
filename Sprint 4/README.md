## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] The main thing I wanted to add that I couldn't get to work was to have a loop that would allow the game to run
  multiple times. I built a framework of a loop, but the game would just end instead of continuing.
* [ ] I would like to change how writing to files work so that it writes each guess into the file more like as a list.
* [ ] Lastly, I would like to display the results of the file to the user so that they can see all of their guesses.
